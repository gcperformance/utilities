# GoC Data utilities
- goc-org-variants: This is a list of all the english and french names of departments and agencies matched to a unique numeric ID that can be found on the Open Government Inventory of Federal Organizations and Interests (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a35cf382-690c-4221-a971-cf0fd189a46f/resource/45069fe9-abe3-437f-97dd-3f64958bfa85). It allows consistent matching of departments across different datasets and naming conventions.
- goc-service-program: This file supports linking service id's from the GC Service Inventory (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/3ac0d080-6149-499a-8b06-7ce5f00ec56c) and program id's for Estimates, Departmental Plans, Departmental Performance Reports, Policy on Results analysis. The program codes were taken from the GC Infobase Open government datasets here (https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a35cf382-690c-4221-a971-cf0fd189a46f/resource/64774bc1-c90a-4ae2-a3ac-d9b50673a895) and were matched manually with program names as defined in the service inventory.
